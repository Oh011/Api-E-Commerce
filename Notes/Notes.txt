1. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
This package is the SQL Server provider for Entity Framework Core (EF Core). It allows EF Core to 
interact with Microsoft SQL Server databases.

🔹 What It Does:
Enables EF Core to connect to SQL Server.

Provides SQL Server-specific functionality (like IDENTITY columns).

Translates LINQ queries into SQL Server-compatible SQL.

Supports migrations and schema management for SQL Server.


2. Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
This package provides EF Core command-line tools for managing migrations and updating the database.

🔹 What It Does:
Allows you to run EF Core commands like:



----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools is Installed in the projcet that contains Connection String :

builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(Options =>
{
//Options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnectionString"));
Options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetSection("ConnectionStrings")["DefaultConnectionString"]);

});

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Migrations is Saved in Infrastructre\Persistence

in the Package Manager Console : Infrastructre\Persistence

Data Seeding:

The DbInitializer class is used to:
✅ Apply database migrations (update the database structure).
✅ Insert initial data (seed data like product types, brands, etc.).
✅ Ensure the database is ready before the API starts handling requests.

In Program.cs:

//This method InitializeDbAsync is a helper function that initializes the database
async Task InitializeDbAsync(WebApplication app)
{

using var scope = app.Services.CreateScope();

//This allows retrieving services like IDbInitializer that are registered in dependency injection (DI).

var DbInitializer =scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IDbInitializer>();

//Gets an instance of IDbInitializer

await DbInitializer.InitializeAsync();  

}

ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> is a thread-safe dictionary in C# that allows multiple threads to read 
and write simultaneously without requiring explicit locks.

✅ Atomic Operations – Methods like TryAdd, TryUpdate, and TryRemove ensure safe modifications.
✅ Prevents Data Corruption – No race conditions when multiple threads modify the dictionary.

sing GetOrAdd and AddOrUpdate
These methods ensure safe insertion and updates.

Get or Add a Value
If the key exists, it returns the existing value.
If the key does not exist, it adds the value.

--> Dtos will be in Shared Project .

 It's better to use record for DTOs because:

✔️ Value equality – Two DTOs with the same data are considered equal, making comparisons easier.
✔️ Immutable by default – Helps prevent accidental modification of DTOs, making them safer.

🏆 When Should You Use record for DTOs?
✔️ If DTOs are immutable (read-only data transfer) ✅
✔️ If you need to compare DTOs by value (e.g., caching, deduplication) ✅
✔️ If you want cleaner, more maintainable code ✅

🔹 What is a Primary Constructor in C#?
A primary constructor in C# is a new feature in C# 12 that allows defining constructor parameters directly
in the class or struct declaration, reducing boilerplate code.It’s mainly used for data-centric 
types, such as DTOs, configuration objects, and lightweight models.

---> public class Person(string Name, int Age); // Primary Constructor

AutoMapper is a library in .NET that simplifies object-to-object mapping, eliminating the need for 
manual property assignments.

🔹 Why use AutoMapper?
✔️ Reduces boilerplate code when mapping between objects (e.g., DTOs to Entities).
✔️ Ensures consistency in mapping logic across an application.
✔️ Supports custom mappings and transformations.

using AutoMapper;

public class UserProfile : Profile
{
    public UserProfile()
    {
        CreateMap<User, UserDto>(); // Mapping User → UserDto
    }
}

builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(Program)); // Register AutoMapper


in The services:

public class UserService
{
    private readonly IMapper _mapper;

}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 What is the Service Manager Class in C#?
The Service Manager class is a centralized service container that manages multiple services in an application. 
It acts as a wrapper around different services, making them easily accessible.

💡 Think of it as a "facade" that provides a single entry point to multiple services.

🔹 Why Use a Service Manager?
✅ Simplifies Dependency Injection – Reduces constructor clutter.
✅ Improves Maintainability – Centralized service management.
✅ Encapsulates Service Logic – Avoids direct access to repositories.
✅ Enhances Testability – Makes it easier to mock dependencies

public interface IServiceManager
{
    IProductService ProductService { get; }
    IOrderService OrderService { get; }
}

🔹 How to Optimize ServiceManager When Not All Services Are Needed?
If you don't always need both ProductService and OrderService at the same time, you can lazy load 
them or use factory-based dependency injection to improve performance and avoid unnecessary service instantiation.

Lazy Initialization with Lazy<T>
🔹 Delays the creation of services until they are actually accessed.
🔹 Improves performance by not resolving dependencies unless needed.


public class ServiceManager : IServiceManager
{
    private readonly Lazy<IProductService> _productService;
    private readonly Lazy<IOrderService> _orderService;

    public ServiceManager(Lazy<IProductService> productService, Lazy<IOrderService> orderService)
    {
        _productService = productService;
        _orderService = orderService;
    }

    public IProductService ProductService => _productService.Value;
    public IOrderService OrderService => _orderService.Value;
}

===================================================================================

In controllers :

Key Differences:

Return Type:
--> Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<ProductResultDto>>> is more specific about the type of data returned 
    (an IEnumerable<ProductResultDto>).

--> Task<IActionResult> is more generic and doesn't specify the data type that will be returned.

Type Safety:

With ActionResult<T>, the return type is strongly typed, meaning it’s clear that the action will 
return a collection of ProductResultDto objects, making it easier to understand and work with the returned data.

With IActionResult, the return type is not strongly typed, so it’s less explicit about what 
data is being returned, which can be useful in situations where you want to return different 
types of responses (e.g., error messages or various status codes) but don't need a specific type.

When to Use Each:

Use ActionResult<T> (e.g., ActionResult<IEnumerable<ProductResultDto>>) when you want explicit typing 
for your response and want to handle data alongside status codes.

Use IActionResult when you want flexibility and don't need to specify a particular type of data in 
the return. It’s useful when the action might return different types of responses (e.g., error results
, success results with different data types, etc.).

===============================================================================


variables related to the environment (such as connection strings, API keys, feature flags, and 
other configuration settings) should be stored in configuration files or environment variables 
rather than hardcoded in the application. 

-->The appsettings.json file is the most common place to store environment-related variables 
    like database connection strings, API keys, and other settings.

Example:

private readonly IConfiguration _configuration; --> Install Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
var googleMapsApiKey = _configuration["ApiKeys:GoogleMaps"];

IConfiguration → Read configuration settings (from JSON, env vars, etc.) ✅
IConfigurationManager → Modify/add configuration at runtime (introduced in .NET 6) 🔄

app.UseStaticFiles();, ASP.NET automatically maps wwwroot to the base URL.
Anything inside wwwroot is accessible directly via https://your-api.com/.
